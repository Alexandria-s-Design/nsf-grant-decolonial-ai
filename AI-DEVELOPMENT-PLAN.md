# AI Development Plan

## 📋 Overview

This document provides systematic guidance for AI assistants to develop this publication project. Follow the phases sequentially, validate all outputs, and maintain human oversight at every stage.

## 🤖 Recommended AI Models

- **Claude Sonnet 3.5**: Long-form writing, theoretical synthesis, manuscript sections (200K context)
- **GPT-4**: Structured data extraction, table generation, precise outputs  
- **Claude Haiku**: Citation verification, quick tasks, cost-effective operations

## 🔄 Core Workflow

**Pattern**: Generate → Human Review → Revise → Validate → Commit

**Golden Rule**: NEVER merge AI-generated content without human review.

## 📅 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Review project README and research questions
- Understand theoretical frameworks
- Set up file structure and templates
- Create initial outline

### Phase 2: Research & Content Gathering (Weeks 3-6)
- Conduct literature search
- Extract key concepts and citations
- Organize source materials
- Build reference library

### Phase 3: Drafting (Weeks 7-14)
- Write first drafts of all sections
- Create tables and figures
- Develop supplementary materials
- Maintain citation accuracy

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Integration (Weeks 15-18)
- Integrate sections into coherent manuscript
- Ensure theoretical consistency
- Verify all citations
- Polish academic writing

### Phase 5: Revision & Quality Control (Weeks 19-22)
- Internal co-author review
- Revise based on feedback
- Format for target journal
- Proofread thoroughly

### Phase 6: Submission Preparation (Weeks 23-26)
- Create abstract and keywords
- Write cover letter
- Prepare supplementary materials
- Final checks and submission

## ✅ Quality Checkpoints

After each phase:
- ✅ Citation verification (every claim has source)
- ✅ Human review and approval
- ✅ Git commit with descriptive message
- ✅ Update progress tracking

Before submission:
- ✅ All co-authors approve
- ✅ Journal formatting verified
- ✅ Plagiarism check passed
- ✅ All references validated

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Create `documentation/progress.md` with:

| Phase | Start | End | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|-----|--------|-------|
| 1 | | | ⚪ Not Started | |
| 2 | | | ⚪ Not Started | |
| ... | | | | |

## 🎯 AI Prompt Templates

**Literature Synthesis**:
"Synthesize these sources [list citations] on [topic]. Structure: Overview, Key themes, Agreements/disagreements, Gaps. Cite extensively."

**Section Drafting**:
"Write [section name] (target: [X] words) with structure: [outline]. Follow APA 7. Audience: [journal] readers. Integrate these sources: [list]."

**Citation Verification**:
"Verify these citations: [list]. Check: 1) In-text format correct? 2) Reference list entry complete? 3) DOI valid? Report any issues."
