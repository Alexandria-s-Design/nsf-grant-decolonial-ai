## 📝 Writing Process

### Drafting Protocol
1. **First Draft**: Author writes 70-80% complete section
2. **AI Enhancement**: AI polishes language, adds citations, formats
3. **Peer Review**: Co-author reviews for accuracy and coherence
4. **Revision**: Author incorporates feedback
5. **Final Review**: Lead author approves for integration

### Citation Management
- **Tool**: Zotero (shared library)
- **Style**: APA 7th Edition
- **Protocol**: Every claim must have citation, verify DOIs, maintain shared bibliography

### Version Control
- **Branch Strategy**: 
  - `main` = production-ready manuscript
  - `develop` = integration branch
  - `feature/section-name` = individual section work
- **Commit Messages**: Clear, descriptive (e.g., "Add literature review section 2.1")
- **Pull Requests**: Required for all merges, minimum 1 reviewer
