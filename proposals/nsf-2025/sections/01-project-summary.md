# Project Summary: Decolonial AI for K-12 Educational Equity

**Project Title**: The Right Path: Developing a Decolonial Framework for AI Integration in K-12 Education

**Institution**: ModelIt / Discovery Collective
**Principal Investigator**: Dr. Charles Martin, Ed.D.
**Duration**: 3 years
**Total Budget**: $750,000

## Overview

This project addresses the urgent need for equitable, culturally sustaining approaches to artificial intelligence (AI) integration in K-12 education. As AI technologies rapidly transform educational landscapes, marginalized communities face compounded risks of algorithmic bias, cultural erasure, and educational inequity. This research develops, validates, and disseminates **The Right Path**, a comprehensive decolonial framework that centers human flourishing, cultural sovereignty, and educational justice in AI implementation.

## Intellectual Merit

This project advances fundamental knowledge in three critical areas:

1. **Theoretical Innovation**: Synthesizes decolonial theory (Tuck & Yang, 2012; Smith, 2012), critical AI studies (Benjamin, 2019; Noble, 2018), and Indigenous pedagogies (Bang & Medin, 2010; Cajete, 1994) into an actionable educational framework. This represents the first systematic application of decolonial epistemologies to K-12 AI integration.

2. **Methodological Advancement**: Develops and validates the **AI & Human Flourishing Readiness Index**, a novel assessment instrument grounded in participatory design with educators and communities most impacted by algorithmic systems. This tool enables schools to audit AI implementations against equity criteria.

3. **Empirical Contribution**: Conducts multi-site implementation research across diverse K-12 contexts (urban, rural, tribal, under-resourced districts) to generate evidence on effective decolonial AI practices. Mixed-methods research design combines ethnographic observation, participatory action research, and learning analytics.

The project fills critical gaps in educational technology research by centering communities historically excluded from technology design and by operationalizing abstract decolonial principles into concrete educational practices.

## Broader Impacts

This project creates transformative impacts across multiple scales:

### Direct Educational Impact
- **10,000+ students** across 30 partner schools gain access to culturally sustaining AI learning experiences
- **500+ educators** receive professional development in decolonial AI pedagogy
- **15 school districts** implement The Right Path framework, creating models for nationwide adoption

### Systemic Change
- **Policy Influence**: Framework informs state and federal AI policy development (e.g., ED AI Guidance, state computer science standards)
- **Industry Accountability**: Practitioner toolkit with vendor audit protocol holds EdTech companies accountable for equity
- **Community Empowerment**: Participatory design process builds capacity for communities to shape technology on their own terms

### Knowledge Dissemination
- **Open Educational Resources**: Free practitioner toolkit, lesson plans, and assessment instruments
- **Professional Learning Network**: Online community of practice supporting 1,000+ educators nationwide
- **Academic Publications**: Peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, and conference presentations advancing decolonial AI scholarship

### Broadening Participation
Explicit focus on students from groups underrepresented in computing:
- 65% students of color (Black, Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander)
- 45% economically disadvantaged students
- 20% English Language Learners
- 15% students with disabilities
- 25% students in rural/tribal communities

The project creates pathways for these students to become creators—not just consumers—of AI technologies, grounded in their own cultural knowledge systems.

## Target NSF Programs

This proposal aligns with:
