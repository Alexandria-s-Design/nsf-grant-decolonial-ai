# Intellectual Merit: Advancing Decolonial AI Research in K-12 Education

## 1. Introduction and Research Context

### 1.1 The Problem: AI's Colonial Replication in Education

Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming K-12 education through adaptive learning platforms, automated assessment, intelligent tutoring systems, and predictive analytics. However, current AI implementations in schools overwhelmingly reproduce colonial patterns of knowledge production, cultural erasure, and epistemic violence (Mohamed, Png, & Isaac, 2020; Birhane, 2021).

**Evidence of Colonial Patterns**:
- **Algorithmic Bias**: AI systems trained on non-representative data perpetuate racial, linguistic, and cultural biases (Benjamin, 2019; Noble, 2018). Educational AI tools have been shown to misclassify students of color, misinterpret multilingual responses, and devalue Indigenous knowledge systems (Eubanks, 2018).

- **Cultural Erasure**: Dominant AI curricula in K-12 settings center Western epistemologies while marginalizing Indigenous, Afro-diasporic, and Global South ways of knowing (Vossoughi, Hooper, & Escudé, 2016). Students learn to build AI systems that cannot recognize their own cultural contexts.

- **Extractive Data Practices**: EdTech companies extract student data from under-resourced schools without consent, reciprocity, or community benefit—a digital continuation of colonial resource extraction (Williamson, 2017; Perrotta, Gulson, Williamson, & Witzenberger, 2021).

- **Deficit Narratives**: AI-powered "interventions" frame students from marginalized communities as deficient rather than recognizing structural inequities or cultural assets (Paris & Alim, 2017; Yosso, 2005).

### 1.2 The Gap: Absence of Decolonial AI Frameworks for Education

Despite growing critical scholarship on algorithmic justice (Crawford, 2021; O'Neil, 2016) and Indigenous data sovereignty (Walter & Suina, 2019; Rainie, Kukutai, Walter, Figueroa-Rodríguez, Walker, & Axelsson, 2019), K-12 educators lack actionable frameworks for implementing AI in ways that center human flourishing, cultural sovereignty, and educational justice.

**Literature Review Findings**:
We conducted a systematic review of 250+ publications at the intersection of decolonial theory, critical AI studies, and K-12 education (search conducted in ERIC, Education Source, ACM Digital Library, arXiv, 2018-2024). Key findings:

- **Theoretical Development**: Robust critical scholarship on AI's colonial dimensions (Mohamed et al., 2020; Birhane, 2021; Kalluri, 2020) but limited translation to K-12 educational practice
- **Indigenous AI Scholarship**: Emerging work on Indigenous data sovereignty and AI ethics (Lewis, Arista, Pechawis, & Kite, 2018; Kukutai & Taylor, 2016) but minimal application to classroom pedagogy
- **Equity Frameworks**: Multiple frameworks for equitable CS education (Goode, 2007; Margolis & Estrella, 2017; Vakil, 2018) but none explicitly grounded in decolonial epistemology
- **Practitioner Resources**: Lack of accessible tools for K-12 educators to critically evaluate and implement AI technologies

**Research Gap**: No comprehensive framework exists that synthesizes decolonial theory with AI education practice while providing concrete implementation tools for K-12 contexts.

### 1.3 Our Solution: The Right Path Framework

This project develops **The Right Path**, a comprehensive decolonial framework for K-12 AI integration grounded in three epistemological pillars:

1. **Indigenous Pedagogies** (Cajete, 1994; Bang & Medin, 2010; Simpson, 2014): Learning as relational, place-based, intergenerational knowledge transmission rooted in reciprocity and responsibility

2. **Decolonial Theory** (Tuck & Yang, 2012; Smith, 2012; Mignolo & Walsh, 2018): Critical analysis of power, refusal of extractive knowledge production, centering marginalized epistemologies

3. **Critical AI Studies** (Benjamin, 2019; Noble, 2018; Crawford, 2021): Examination of algorithmic bias, data justice, and technology's role in reproducing or challenging oppression

**Theoretical Innovation**: The Right Path is the first framework to synthesize these traditions into an actionable educational model. It operationalizes abstract decolonial principles through concrete pedagogical practices, curriculum design guidelines, and institutional policies.

## 2. Research Questions

This project investigates three interconnected research questions:

**RQ1: Framework Development & Validation**
- How can decolonial epistemologies inform AI integration in K-12 education?
- What pedagogical practices, curricular approaches, and institutional policies constitute a decolonial AI framework?
- How do educators, students, and community members validate and refine the framework through participatory design?

**RQ2: Implementation & Outcomes**
- What are the effects of decolonial AI pedagogy on student learning, engagement, and sense of belonging in CS?
- How does The Right Path framework support educators in critically evaluating and implementing AI technologies?
- What institutional conditions enable or constrain decolonial AI implementation?

**RQ3: Equity & Impact**
- How does decolonial AI pedagogy broaden participation among students from groups underrepresented in computing?
- What are differential impacts across diverse cultural contexts (urban, rural, tribal communities)?
- How does the framework support students in becoming critical creators (not just consumers) of AI technologies?

## 3. Conceptual Framework: The Right Path

### 3.1 Four Core Dimensions

**Dimension 1: Epistemological Pluralism**
- **Principle**: Multiple ways of knowing are valid and valuable
- **Educational Practice**: AI curricula that integrate Indigenous knowledge systems, Afro-diasporic traditions, and Global South epistemologies alongside Western computational thinking
- **Example**: Students design AI systems that recognize and preserve endangered languages, model traditional ecological knowledge, or document oral histories

**Dimension 2: Data Sovereignty & Justice**
- **Principle**: Communities have rights to control data about themselves (Walter & Suina, 2019)
- **Educational Practice**: Participatory data governance, consent protocols, community benefit agreements
- **Example**: Tribal communities define what student data can be collected, how it's used, and ensure data serves community goals (not corporate extraction)

**Dimension 3: Critical Algorithmic Literacy**
- **Principle**: Understanding AI as sociotechnical system embedded in power relations (Benjamin, 2019)
- **Educational Practice**: Students analyze bias in real AI systems, trace training data origins, examine whose interests algorithms serve
- **Example**: High schoolers audit facial recognition systems for racial bias, investigate predictive policing algorithms, or critique adaptive learning platforms

**Dimension 4: Human Flourishing & Relationality**
- **Principle**: Technology serves human and ecological well-being, not extraction or domination
- **Educational Practice**: AI projects centered on community needs, environmental sustainability, cultural preservation
- **Example**: Students build AI tools that support elders, strengthen Indigenous language revitalization, or monitor local ecosystem health

## 4. Methodological Innovation

### 4.1 Participatory Action Research Design

This project employs Participatory Action Research (PAR) (Torre & Ayala, 2009; Cammarota & Fine, 2008), centering communities as co-researchers, not research subjects. Methodological innovations include:

**Innovation 1: Community Research Teams**
Each partner site convenes a Community Research Team (CRT) including educators, students, families, tribal elders, and community leaders. CRTs:
- Co-design research protocols
- Lead data collection and analysis
- Determine research dissemination strategies
- Control data governance

**Innovation 2: Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR)**
Students (grades 6-12) conduct research on AI in their own schools:
- Identify research questions about AI implementation
- Collect data (surveys, interviews, observations)
- Analyze findings using critical frameworks
- Present recommendations to school administrators

**Innovation 3: Indigenist Research Methodologies**
For tribal partner sites, research follows Indigenist principles (Kovach, 2009; Wilson, 2008; Chilisa, 2012):
- Relational accountability to community
- Reciprocity and benefit to community
- Tribal sovereignty over research process
- Integration of traditional knowledge protocols

### 4.2 Mixed-Methods Research Design

**Qualitative Strand**:
- **Ethnographic Observation**: 1,200+ hours classroom observation across 30 partner sites documenting decolonial AI pedagogy
- **Semi-Structured Interviews**: 150+ interviews with educators, students, administrators, families
- **Focus Groups**: 40 focus groups examining cultural relevance, student engagement, implementation challenges
- **Document Analysis**: Curriculum materials, student work, policy documents, vendor contracts
- **Analysis**: Iterative coding using decolonial frameworks; member checking with Community Research Teams

**Quantitative Strand**:
- **AI & Human Flourishing Readiness Index**: Pre/post assessment at all 30 sites (n~500 educators, n~10,000 students)
- **Learning Analytics**: Student engagement, project completion, CS skill development
- **Broadening Participation Metrics**: Enrollment, persistence, identity development in CS (disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, disability, language)
- **Analysis**: Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to account for nesting of students within classrooms within schools; propensity score matching for quasi-experimental comparison

**Integration**:
Mixed-methods integration through joint displays, meta-inferences, and participatory data interpretation sessions with Community Research Teams.
