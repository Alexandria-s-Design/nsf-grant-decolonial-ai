# Broader Impacts: Transforming AI Education for Equity and Justice

## 1. Overview: Multi-Scale Impact Strategy

This project creates transformative impacts at five interconnected scales: **individual student outcomes**, **educator practice**, **institutional change**, **community empowerment**, and **systemic policy influence**. All impacts are designed through participatory processes with communities most affected by AI systems, ensuring relevance, sustainability, and justice.

## 2. Individual Student Impacts: Broadening Participation in Computing

### 2.1 Direct Student Reach

**Target**: 10,000+ students across 30 partner schools (3-year project period)

**Demographics** (based on partner school selection criteria):
- 65% students of color (35% Latinx, 15% Black/African American, 10% Native American/Alaska Native, 5% Pacific Islander)
- 45% economically disadvantaged (eligible for free/reduced lunch)
- 20% English Language Learners
- 15% students with disabilities
- 25% students in rural or tribal communities

**Comparison to National CS Demographics**: Partner student demographics intentionally over-represent groups underrepresented in computing compared to national CS course enrollment (Code.org, 2023: 28% students of color, 15% economically disadvantaged).

### 2.2 Student Outcomes: Beyond Technical Skills

Traditional CS education metrics (course enrollment, AP exam scores) fail to capture holistic student development. This project measures multidimensional outcomes:

**Dimension 1: Computational Skills & AI Literacy**
- Ability to design, build, and debug AI systems
- Understanding of machine learning concepts (training data, algorithms, bias)
- Proficiency in programming (Python, block-based coding)
- **Innovation**: Critical algorithmic literacy—analyzing power, bias, and ethics

**Dimension 2: Identity & Belonging**
- CS identity development: "I am the kind of person who can succeed in CS"
- Sense of belonging in CS spaces
- Recognition of cultural knowledge as valuable in computing
- Resistance to deficit narratives about one's community

**Dimension 3: Agency & Empowerment**
- Self-efficacy as technology creator (not just consumer)
- Ability to critique and challenge unjust AI systems
- Vision for using AI to serve community goals
- Leadership in participatory design processes

**Dimension 4: Cultural & Community Connection**
- Affirmation of cultural identity through computing
- Integration of traditional knowledge with AI
- Commitment to using technology for community benefit
- Intergenerational knowledge exchange

**Measurement**: Pre/post student surveys (AI & Human Flourishing Readiness Index—Student Version), portfolio analysis of student AI projects, focus groups, longitudinal tracking of CS course-taking and career pathways (with consent).

### 2.3 Pathways to CS Careers & Higher Education

Decolonial AI pedagogy creates **sustainable pathways** for students underrepresented in computing:

**Short-term** (during project):
- Increased enrollment in CS courses (target: 40% increase in partner schools)
- Higher persistence in CS (target: 85% retention rate vs. 60% national average)
- Greater diversity in advanced CS courses (AP CS, dual enrollment)

**Medium-term** (2-5 years post-intervention):
- Increased CS major declarations in college (tracking through alumni surveys)
- Participation in computing-related internships and research experiences
- Formation of student-led technology organizations in their communities

**Long-term** (5-10 years):
- Entry into computing careers with commitment to ethical practice
- Graduate education in AI/CS with focus on justice
- Community technology leadership roles

**Support Structures**: Project creates alumni network, connects students with mentors from underrepresented backgrounds in tech, provides scholarship information, and facilitates research opportunities.

## 5. Community Impacts: Centering Marginalized Voices

### 5.1 Participatory Design as Community Empowerment

Traditional educational research extracts knowledge from communities without reciprocity or benefit. This project models an alternative:

**Community Research Teams (CRTs)**: 30 teams (one per partner site) composed of educators, students, families, tribal elders, community organizers. CRTs:
- Define research questions relevant to their context
- Lead data collection and analysis
- Determine research dissemination strategies
- Control data governance and use
- Receive compensation for intellectual labor ($5,000 annual stipend per CRT + $100/meeting for members)

**Capacity Building**: Project provides training for CRT members in:
- Participatory research methods
- Critical data analysis
- Community organizing and advocacy
- Academic writing and presentation (for those interested)

**Long-term Impact**: CRTs become ongoing infrastructure for community voice in technology decisions, extending beyond this project to future school initiatives.

### 5.2 Cultural Preservation & Revitalization Through AI

AI projects serve community-defined goals:

**Examples from Pilot Work**:
- **Tribal Language AI** (Diné/Navajo community): Students built speech recognition model for Diné Bizaad, supporting language revitalization efforts; tool now used by tribal language programs
- **Oral History Archive** (African American community, Mississippi): Students created AI-powered searchable database of elder interviews, preserving community memory and resisting historical erasure
- **Environmental Monitoring** (Pacific Islander community, Hawaiʻi): Students developed AI image recognition for monitoring coral reef health, supporting traditional ecological stewardship

**Project Support**: Each partner site receives $10,000 community project fund to support student AI projects aligned with community needs.

**Intellectual Property**: Communities retain ownership of all data, code, and cultural knowledge. Project establishes protocols for data sovereignty and traditional knowledge protection.

### 5.3 Economic Justice & Community Benefit

**Equitable Resource Distribution**:
- 70% of project budget flows directly to partner schools and communities (not retained by research institution)
- Community members compensated for expertise (e.g., elder honoraria for cultural knowledge sharing)
- Equipment and materials remain with schools after project conclusion

**Job Creation**:
- 15 community member positions (coordinators, cultural liaisons)
- 30 graduate student positions (priority recruitment from partner communities)
- Paid student internships and research assistantships

**Long-term Economic Pathways**:
- Students gain skills for high-wage computing careers
- Communities develop capacity to negotiate with tech companies
- Local technology ecosystems strengthened

### 8.2 Asset-Based Approaches

**Rejecting Deficit Narratives**: Project does not frame students/communities as "lacking" or "deficient." Instead:
- Curriculum highlights contributions of diverse communities to computing (e.g., Indigenous computational thinking, African mathematical innovations)
- Student cultural knowledge positioned as valuable resource for AI design
- Community expertise recognized and compensated

**Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy** (Paris & Alim, 2017):
- AI projects rooted in students' cultural contexts
- Multiple languages welcomed and valued
- Family and community knowledge integrated into curriculum
- Students see themselves as knowledge creators

### 8.3 Intersectionality & Inclusive Design

**Universal Design for Learning (UDL)**:
- Multiple means of representation (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Multiple means of action/expression (coding, writing, video, art)
- Multiple means of engagement (individual, collaborative, community-based projects)

**Accessibility**: All materials designed for accessibility (screen reader compatible, captions, plain language, translation)
