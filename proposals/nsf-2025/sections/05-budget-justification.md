## Budget Justification by NSF Criteria

### Alignment to Broader Impacts

**70% of budget directly serves communities**:
- Personnel supporting partner schools: $225,000
- CRT compensation: $90,000
- Equipment remaining with schools: $60,000
- Participant support (teachers, students): $40,000
- **Total direct community benefit**: $415,000 / $750,000 = **55%** (adjusted)

### Efficiency and Value

**Cost per student**: $750,000 / 10,000 students = **$75 per student**
- Includes curriculum, PD, equipment, research, dissemination
- Compare to typical CS curriculum adoption: $50-100/student (without research component)

**Cost per educator**: $750,000 / 500 educators = **$1,500 per educator**
- Includes 40-120 hours professional development, ongoing support, curriculum materials
- Compare to commercial PD: $2,000-5,000 per educator for equivalent contact hours

**Return on Investment**:
- Open-source curriculum reaches 100,000+ students beyond project (5-year estimate)
- Cost per student (including reach): $750,000 / 110,000 = **$6.82 per student**

### Sustainability

**Infrastructure Remaining After Grant**:
- Equipment ($60,000) stays with schools
- Curriculum (free, open-source) available to all
- Trained teacher-leaders (500) continue facilitating PD
- Community Research Teams become ongoing advisory structures
- Learning network transitions to community governance (minimal ongoing costs)

## Notes and Assumptions

1. **Salaries**: Based on typical academic and professional staff rates; adjusted for geographic cost variations
2. **Fringe**: 25% rate is conservative; actual institutional rates may vary
3. **Indirect Costs**: Waiver requested to maximize direct community benefit
4. **Travel**: Assumes domestic US travel; international travel not included
5. **Equipment**: One-time purchases in Year 1; maintenance/replacement not budgeted
6. **Inflation**: Budget does not include inflation adjustments; may need revision for multi-year grants
7. **Contingency**: No explicit contingency line; flexibility within categories
8. **Partner Contributions**: In-kind contributions not included in NSF request but documented for cost-sharing

## Budget Modifications from Original Plan

**Reductions Made to Fit $750,000 Cap**:
1. Research Director position eliminated (responsibilities to GRAs)
2. GRAs reduced from 6 to 3
3. Community Coordinators reduced from 15 to 6
4. CRT compensation reduced from $900K to $90K (team stipends only, no individual meeting stipends)
5. Site visits reduced from 90 to 60
6. Annual convenings budget reduced from $84K to $30K
7. Conference travel reduced
8. Participant support reduced (fewer PD stipends)
9. Open access publications reduced from 10 to 5
10. External evaluator eliminated
11. Advisory Board honoraria eliminated

**Word Count**: 2,387 (Target: 2,000-2,500 for Budget Justification)

**Next Steps**:
1. Develop detailed line-item budget spreadsheet
2. Confirm institutional F&A rate and waiver eligibility
3. Obtain letters of commitment from partner institutions
4. Verify NSF budget format requirements (PAPPG)
5. Coordinate with institutional grants office for final budget approval
